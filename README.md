# Arduino-String-Builder

The Arduino String Builder is a small utility to quickly create a simple string containing all the words needed for the Arduino to output.
The individual words can be retrieved via a defined coding. The software does the coding and assembles the string from the table. 
All words are stored in an array and can be used globally in the program.
